# 0.7.4 Change Log

## Memory Usage and Optimization
- Tons of resources that were previously loaded into RAM at app launch are now loaded asynchronously on demand. RAM usage should hover around 300-400 Mbs instead of the previous 1.1-1.2 Gbs, and launch is significantly quicker.

## Push Notifications
- Adventure Guild now supports basic iOS Push Notifications.

## In-Game Store and Microtransactions
- Added a bunch of new items to the Guildium store.
- Implemented Guildium purchases for iOS and Android.

## Bug Fixes and Improvements
- Addressed a ton of launch issues. Too many to count and not even worth listing here.
- Replaced a lot of old sprites. Too many to count and not even worth listing here.
- Some actions, such as unequipping items and ending your turn prematurely, now have confirmation steps to prevent accidents.
- Change password modal is a little bit larger.
- Fixed a bug where wardrobe helmets would not render to Adventurer portraits.
