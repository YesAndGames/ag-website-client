# 0.4.0 Change Log

## Adventures and Combat
- The fifth and sixth Blizzard Bluffs Adventure locations, The Frigid Crest and The Polar Peak, are now available.
- Enemies now alert other enemies within 6 tiles when they are alerted by Adventurers.
- Rebalanced Adventurer progression. Adventurers now get significantly more stats from levels (1 per level -> 5 per level), but don't get any inherent armor. Gear will now roll modifier bonuses between level and level * 2.

## Bug Fixes and Polish
- Fixed a bug where the skill Engulf left a lingering flame on the target tile.
- Fixed bugs related to old token login attempts.
- Fixed a critical bug where you could commit the same Adventurer to an Adventure twice.
- Improved performance when pathfinding for movement actions.
- Some internal changes related to cosmetic items that aren't ready yet.
